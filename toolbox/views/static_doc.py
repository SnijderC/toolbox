        Render a static jade or Markdown file..
        
        Originally all content was dynamically loaded from the database.
        The format was Markdown. But since layouts, specifically the
        landing page became so complex, Markdown wasn't enough.
        
        Markdown's HTML support is limited and requires hacky formatting.
        
        Loading Jade into the DB would have been (and still is) an option.
        However in the interest of more rapid deployment I chose not to.
        And frankly.. because anyone editing those files would require 
        some web knowledge anyway. 
        
        So sorry for this hacky workaround but to get a nice title in the
        titlebar please add your title to the dict in:
        templates/static_file_title.py
